    m_Localized: "The agriculture of Bissau has seen some serious shocks in the last
      century:\r\nfirst the penetration of the colonial authorities, who sought to
      monopolize\r\nexports and move peasants from their traditional lifestyle of
      subsistence and \r\nsmall-scale trade to forced labour plantations. Secondly,
      the revolutionary war\r\nhas brought further ruin and chaos to cultivation.
      Cabral, an agronomist who\r\nattentively studied Guinean agriculture, was particularly
      concerned by the state\r\nof the Guinean peasantry: we must ensure the safety
      and provide the\r\ninfrastructure for plantations of crops such as the traditional
      groundnut and the\r\ncoveted rice, providing a lifeline both for our peasants
      and our revolution,\r\nwho direly needs the funding from their export."

    m_Localized: "Portugal was always backwards when it come to illiteracy compared
      to its'\r\nEuropean neighbors: only in the 1940's did literacy even surpass
      50% and\r\nwhile the regime made strides in combating illiteracy among schoolchildren,
      \r\nit remains rampant in adults. In Africa the situation is incomparably worse:
      \r\nilliteracy is well over the 90's and the few educational institutions that
      exist \r\nare mostly targeted towards whites. A comprehensive education initiative
      \r\nmust be undertake when the war is over, but we should still focus our \r\nmeager
      resources in beginning education now, especially as literacy is vital\r\n for
      the training of educated, learned political cadres."

      the Portuguese government. Indeed, even many attempts at expansion\r\nof colonial
      settlement failed due to the inability to deal with such problems\r\nas tropical
      diseases. Not only disease afflicts us, but also the wounds \r\ninflicted on
      us by our opressors both among fighters and civilians: we can't\r\n only really
      on humanitarian aid, we must provide for our people where they live!"

    m_Localized: "Our people do not want war, but years of untold cruelty and oppression
      \r\nforced it onto us. But wars are not won by mere devotion and ideals: they\r\nare
      won by people. Our foremost efforts must be guided towards the \r\npromotion
      of a people's army, with a rifle by their side, the love of their \r\nneighbor's
      in the heart and a committed desire to fighting for a egalitarian\r\nfree society,
      where no man opresses man."
