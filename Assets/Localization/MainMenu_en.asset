    m_Localized: Your main goal is to liberate colonial territory. To do this, you

      it. With click and drag you can move. Movements can't be interrupted once started.

    m_Localized: 'You can only move into enemy territory from friendly territory
      and you can always move into friendly territory, as indicated by the flags.
      The same applies to the enemy: use this to your advantage by building in safe
      areas and capturing around enemy units to trap and destroy them.'

    m_Localized: When both a friendly and an enemy unit occupy the same sector, a

    m_Localized: 'The red target marks Bissau, the colonial capital that gives portuguese
      Guinea it''s name. As the center of the colonial regime it is highly fortified:
      it is best to avoid it as capturing is nigh-impossible.'

      upgrades there will be vital for the battle. A significantly larger button
      will be slowly filled: when it is fully coloured, you control enough land to
      declare independence, winning the game.'
