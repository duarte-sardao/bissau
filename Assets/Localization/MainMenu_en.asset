    m_Localized: Your main goal is to liberate colonial territory. To do this, you
      must move your units into Portuguese territory, where they'll slowly capture
      it. With click and drag you can move. Movements can't be interrupted once started.

    m_Localized: 'You can only move into enemy territory from friendly territory
      and you can always move into friendly territory, as indicated by the flags.
      The same applies to the enemy: use this to your advantage by building in safe
      areas and capturing around enemy units to trap and destroy them.'

      Guinea it''s name. As the center of the colonial regime it is highly fortified:
      it is best to avoid it as capturing is nigh-impossible.'

    m_Localized: 'What followed Guinea-Bissau''s declaration of independence wasn''t
      the utopic, self-governing society as envisioned, but continued turmoil, coups,
      poverty and undevelopment.


      The more cynical (or racist) might ask:
      what was the point? Are they better off? Was the struggle worth it? Of course
      it was worth it. There are immense challenges with post-colonial statehood,
      both internal and external. And while neo-colonialism remains a facet of our
      world and imperialism seems almost inescapable, humanity should cherish anti-colonial
      struggles: those won, lost and ongoing. Because regardless of what the future
      may still lie Guinea-Bissau, they looked an inhuman regime in the eyes, a regime
      that denied their very humanity and through force of arms forced it to recognize
      it. No one can take away the greatness of that feat.


      So the struggle
      for a better world continues but we shouldn''t let this breed cynicism or desperation:
      it took centuries of struggle against opressive feudalism and monarchism to
      reach what we call modern democracies. And it may be many more before Liberty,
      Equality and Fraternity are fully realized, for everyone.


      As Cabral
      said, we should tell no lies and claim no easy victories. It won''t be easy,
      but inspired by the struggles of those who came before us, such as the heroic
      people of Guinea, we can move forward and fight for a world where all men are
      brothers.'

      economics, and society (Marxist regimes series)\n- The Liberation War in Guinea-Bissau
      Reconsidered\n\nI'd reccommend those interested to give these a look. Also
      watch the movie Mortu Nega, available on Youtube, as well as the writings of
      Am\xEDlcar Cabral."
