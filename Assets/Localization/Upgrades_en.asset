    m_Localized: "Our ultimate goal is of a true people's democracy, but the reality
      of war makes this a far-off reality. So far, the Permanent Commission, headed
      by Am\xEDlcar Cabral, Lu\xEDs Cabral and Aristides Pereira, has made most significant
      decisions, both for security reasons and the simple unviability of uniting
      representatives across all zones. For the time being we will have to further
      rely on it for our decision-making."

    m_Localized: Cabral is cognizant of the importance of revolutionary democracy
      and the dangers of growing bureaucratic centralism. Despite this, the reality
      is quite harsh, while we held elections in the liberated zones, and while the
      most recent reorganization of the party has reiterated the need for elections
      on party committees through the village assemblies, we simply don't have the
      capacity to organize more for now. Like so many other problems, we can only
      hope this can be rectified when peace comes.

    m_Localized: Portugal has made quite frequent use of dissastified party members
      in their attempts to sabotage our movement and drive a wedge between us. Truthfully,
      the current functioning of the political apparatus, with top-down leadership,
      lack of elections and difficulty for cadres to move up has created a hotbed
      of dissent. A concerted effort must be made to ensure the loyalty of party
      members and to assuage their concerns as much as feasible.
