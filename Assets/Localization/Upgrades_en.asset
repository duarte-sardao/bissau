      Ever threatened with retaliation from the hated "yanquis", Cuba has fashioned
      itself as a fighter against imperialism with unmatched selflessness. Fidel
      Castro has proposed sending significant numbers of volunteers, but worried
      about "de-nationalizing" the struggle, Cabral has limited this to a small contingent,
      who nonetheless carries valuable experience and will boost our morale.

      these amongst our army, enemy air raids will become much more difficult.'
