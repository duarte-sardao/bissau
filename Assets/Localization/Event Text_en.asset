      conduct has fallen out of favour."

      of the colony was driving sympathy for the revolutionaries. Understanding this,
      Sp\xEDnola has begun undertaking a hearts and minds campaign, for example,
      reducing some of the most over discrimination and rallying support among traditional
      leadership. It will be harder to gain ground from now on."

    m_Localized: "Reports have shown that General Sp\xEDnola has began a massive
      undertaking of recruitment of indigenous fighters, reducing dependence on the
      metropole and shoring up local support. This will allow the Portuguese to more
      quickly recover casualties in the field and their troops will be viewed with
      less suspicion as they seek to increase control of territory."
